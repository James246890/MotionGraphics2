    <p>Computer Graphics and Design I</p>
<p>This introductory graphic design course explores basic tools and processes to create digital works. It relates and
applies creative expression and design principles from the field of advertising and commercial art. Students gain
practical experience in generating original ideas, executing layouts, hand- rendering and preparing artwork for
reproduction. It also provides a historical and contemporary view of art as students learn to critique work.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics and Design II</p>
<p>This graphic design course continues application of tools and processes begun in Computer Graphics I to create
digital works and text to communicate messages. It emphasizes design elements and principles in purposeful
arrangement using both hand rendered and computer-generated design. Focus will be on advanced applications to
create art products, such as advertisements, product designs and identity symbols. It investigates the computer's
influence on and role in creating contemporary designs and provides a cultural and historical study of master
design works of different periods and styles. </p>
<p>Motion Graphics/Video</p>
<p>This advanced course engages students with the materials, processes and artistic techniques involved in motion
graphics, animation and video. Students learn about the operation of a camera, lighting techniques, camera angles,
depth of field, composition, story boarding, sound capture and editing techniques. As students advance and the
instruction becomes more refined, they are encouraged to develop their own artistic style. Students may also
study major filmmakers/cinematographers and their films to learn about film, television and video and their
relationships to drama and theater.</p>
